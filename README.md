L-System Generator
Overview
This web application allows users to generate both stochastic and deterministic L-Systems, producing fascinating patterns and structures based on simple rules. L-Systems, or Lindenmayer Systems, are formal grammars used to model the growth of biological structures, such as plants, and are also employed in computer graphics for procedural generation.

Features
Stochastic and Deterministic: Choose between stochastic and deterministic L-Systems to explore both random and predictable patterns.

Customizable Rules: Adjust the rules for each symbol (F, G, +, -, *, /, [, ]) to experiment with various shapes and structures.

Interactive Parameters: Modify parameters such as angle, length, and axiom to observe the impact on the generated patterns.

Visualization: View the L-System in real-time as it evolves, providing a dynamic representation of the growth process.

Save and Share: Save your favorite L-System configurations and share them with others using unique URLs.

Usage Guide
Choose L-System Type:

Select whether you want to generate a stochastic or deterministic L-System.
Customize Rules:

Adjust the rules for each symbol (F, G, +, -, *, /, [, ]) to define the behavior of the system.
Set Parameters:

Modify parameters like angle, length, and axiom to influence the appearance of the generated pattern.
Generate and Visualize:

Click the "Generate" button to see the L-System evolve in real-time, visualizing the growth process.

Explore and Learn:
Experiment with different combinations of rules and parameters to discover the diverse range of patterns that can be created with L-Systems.
